            <h2>NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF AI IN SOCIETY</h2><br>
            <p>As with any new technology, there are potential drawbacks and risks associated with AI that must be considered. One of the main concerns is job displacement, as AI and automation have the potential to replace many jobs currently performed by humans. This can lead to unemployment and economic inequality, particularly for those with low-skilled jobs.</p>
            <p>Another concern is the potential for bias and discrimination in AI systems. These systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on, and if the data is biased, the system will be too. This can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, such as minorities and women.</p>
            <p>Privacy is also a concern with AI, as these systems are capable of collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data. This raises questions about who has access to this data and how it is being used.</p>
            <p>Finally, there is the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes, such as cyber attacks or surveillance. It is important for developers and policymakers to consider these risks and work to address them to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly.</p>
            <p>To address these risks and drawbacks, it is important for researchers, developers, policymakers, and the public to work together to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that benefits society as a whole. This includes ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and built with diversity and inclusion in mind.</p>
